SCHEDULE
========

Our project is a Novel Website called Bayun. You can read, write and comment in the website.
Here is the time schedule in the following:

## Week 1
*A good beginning is half the battle*
In this week, we try to depict the whole picture of the project and arrange the delegation of responsibilities. At the same time, it is also of great significance to figure out what techniques we should learn for the sake of implementing Bayun. For instatnce, html5, css3 and js are needed for foreground and python, flask and leancloud for background.

## Week 2
*No setbacks are insurmountable*
As all of our team are not familiar to foreground and background development, it will definitely take a lot of time to be adept in relative techniques. Daunting tasks though it seems, we will exert ourselves to have a good understanding of them and never surrender.

## Week 3
*A little attemp*
Now that we have learned for a week, it is time to give a shot. In the week, we will write some web pages, like the main page and read page of bayun. Making sure that the connection between client and server works is the prime purpose.

## Week 4
*Go deeper*
Let's do some more challenging things. We will strive to write more pages, and finish the registration and login transaction.

## Week 5 & 6
*Novel Writing, we are coming!*
Now it is the most exciting moment, and we will start implementing the concept of branch novel, which means we can write novels with some collaborators and choose your favorite branch to read.

## Week 7 & 8
*Debugging! Debugging! Debugging!*


I believe we will create an amazing website with our passions and enthusiasm, tenacity and perserverance.

THE END!
